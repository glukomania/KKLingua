                  <p>I love Katka's classNamees: I feel like Czech is finally starting to "click" and it's thanks to her (because I tried before other ways but they didn't work).
She motivates me a lot to study and learn because the lessons are very interesting, the things she teaches are very useful, it's very intuitive and she is, at the same time, strict and kind and funny.</p>

                  <p>I have done Czech classNamees & private lessons before which also were great but with Katka it is another 'upgrade' :). Very professional teacher who is very focused & dedicated to help you get better. She motivates you to study and makes learning the language fun (yes, it's possible :)). Also, very convenient that she is coming to my office for lessons. I strongly recommend Katka to anyone who wants to learn Czech.</p>

                  <p>I can recommended Kateřina for many reasons. She is always prepared and therefore the lessons are well organized and easy to follow. She is also very versatile and you can tailor your className to your needs. Flexibility is also one of her advantages. Besides, she possesses the knowledge of teaching methods, so she is able to look at vocabulary or grammar from all angles. If you are looking for a qualified, resourceful and well organized teacher Kateřina will be good choice.</p>

                  <p>Kateřina is nice and kind person. Lesson with her passed sooo quickly, because it was interesting and fun.
She was very well prepared and able to lead the className with tons of games and interesting tasks.
Atmosphere during the className was fun and relaxed, so you can really enjoy it without any stress.</p>

                  <p>I have started learning Czech with Kateřina as a beginner and I am very happy with the choice I've made. She is very professional, only uses simple Czech phrases when explaining new content and this has helped me learn a lot in a very short time. 
I would recommend her to anyone who would like to give this interesting language a try, as she is also a lot of fun to be with and always very encouraging and supportive.</p>
